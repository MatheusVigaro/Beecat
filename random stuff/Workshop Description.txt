[h1]Spread your wings over this barren world![/h1]

[b]Disclaimer! This is a very early prototype, some things are susceptible to change or unfinished. This character's campaign is in development and hasn't been implemented yet, the world and creature spawns are the same as Hunter's for now.[/b]

An agile creature, Beecat is able to move quickly through the world, and has the ability to fly through short distances (or until they get tired), this enhanced agility and mobility comes at a cost, though, the Beecat uses some of the nutrients they consume to fuel their powerful muscles and wings, only allowing half of the nutrition acquired from the food they consume to be stored for hibernation. They make up for that, however, with the ability to store nutrients in their long and thick tail, allowing for a large amount of food to be stored for the next cycle.
